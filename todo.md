General
=======

* Get rid of autobug (using inprod?)

* Replace Poisson by negbin (binomial by beta binomial) and test limit

* Mike thinks simplify bugs code by looping once!

Specific
========

* Reporting delay
 * backup and glitches

* Sub-boxes within a week
 * parameterizing the generation interval
 * individual heterogeneity (e.g., super-spreaders)

* Beta responses
 * time, space, incidence

* Spatial structure
 * even two or three subpopulations might help

* Use death and/or HCW
