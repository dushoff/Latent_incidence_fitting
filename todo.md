Predictions
===========

Make out/ subdirectory structure

Structure
=========

* Figure out how to qsub on yushan

* write a make rule for wrapR.r

Try to improve mixing
=====================

* Why does the littleR trick not seem to work? How can the kernel mixing be improved?

Model
========

* Reporting delay
 * backup and glitches

* Sub-boxes within a week
 * parameterizing the generation interval
 * individual heterogeneity (e.g., super-spreaders)

* Changing transmission-rates
 * time, space, incidence

* Spatial structure
 * even two or three subpopulations might help

* Use death and/or HCW
