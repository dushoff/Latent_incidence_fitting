Flow
====

* More parameters, better make parsing

Model
========

* Reporting delay
 * backup and glitches

* Sub-boxes within a week
 * parameterizing the generation interval
 * individual heterogeneity (e.g., super-spreaders)

* Changing transmission-rates
 * time, space, incidence

* Spatial structure
 * even two or three subpopulations might help

* Use death and/or HCW
